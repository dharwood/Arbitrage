Arbitrage is a system for building trading simulation games. The project was inspired by TradeWars 2002, an old and successful trading simulation game set in a semi-Star Trek universe. This project was started in the Summer of 2012 as a project for the Open Source Development class at Portland State University. If you would liek to work on the project, the code base can be found at https://github.com/dharwood/Arbitrage/

Building the project:
To run this program, users will need Python 2.7 (NOT python 3) and Twisted 12.1.0 or later. Once the pre-requisites are installed, enter the directory that Arbitrage is in and enter the command `python arbitrage.py`. Arbitrage will set up the server and begin listening for telnet connections. By default, Arbitrage listens on port 8090 of localhost, and runs for one month.

Playing the game:
The game is entirely menu-driven. For each menu the player encounters, they need enter the number next to the action they would like to perform. The game is set to run for a specific amount of time, then end, with the player who has the most money at the end being declared the winner. From here, the host is free to begin another round of the game.

Customization:
Currently, customization is not supported. At a later time, however, it will be possible to apply a "skin" to change the theme of the game.

Known Bugs:
There are plenty of bugs roaming around at the moment. It's still early in the project's life. The primary one to be aware of, though, is that users who disconnect are currently unable to log back in, so disconnecting is essentially the same as burning the account.
