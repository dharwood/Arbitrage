Arbitrage is a system for building trading simulation games. The project was inspired by TradeWars 2002, an old and successful trading simulation game set in a semi-Star Trek universe. This project was started in the Summer of 2012 as a project for the Open Source Development class at Portland State University.

Building the project:
Since Arbitrage is written in python, there's very little setup that needs to be done to make the system install and run. One thing that does need to be done, though, is to run the configuration script to handle the setup and installation

...or, rather, that's what's going to happen. Right now, there's nothing here yet. We all gotta start somewhere, right?
